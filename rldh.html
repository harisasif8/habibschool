    <p id="stdp"> CPPL Conference – July 15th – 19th 2019 <br> <br>
        Day wise Testimony
        <br> <br>
        Habib Public School is always a strong advocate of the training and professional development of their staff. The Professional development can be provided in many ways. It can be made available through external expertise in the form of courses and workshops, through collaboration between schools or teachers, across schools or within the schools.
        <br> <br>
        It is always an urgent educational need that teachers should receive adequate educational and professional training to possess adequate knowledge and teaching skills and to be able to dedicate themselves to the teaching profession. This can be provided through coaching/mentoring, collaborative planning and teaching, and the sharing of good practices.
        <br> <br>
        HPS uses a variety of schedules to provide this collaborative learning and work time for teachers. The beginning of the new academic year 2019- 20 commenced with new progressions in the Staff Professional learning and personal learning by organizing the first CPPL conference from July 15 th – 19 th , 2019 under the name of the newly revived department for Teachers’ Professional Development. The glimpse of each day portrayed is the flashback for everyone to enjoy it again with the same essence.</p>

                <br> <br> <h3 id="rdh1">Day 5 – July 19th 2019</h3> 
            <p id="stdp">The last day of CPPL Conference was full of excitement and bundle of action. There was everything to suit everyone’s taste. It turned out to be a day HPS will always remember. The key note session was organized in gymnasium which was carried out by Danish Sayanee. He motivated the teachers through his presentation which went quite well. The teachers, then, moved to attend CPPL Sessions,
                executed by our diligent teachers.
                <br> <br>
                The real fun began when everyone gathered in the gymnasium again for Team Building Activity. It was Treasure Hunt. The teachers were given time of 30mins to find thirty clues placed at different sites in the school. Every team had a different color code and they were to report back about their status at sharp 12. The team who reported on time with maximum number of clues, was considered as the winner.
                <br> <br>
                The session was ended with closing ceremony. The teachers who volunteer their time to share their knowledge and held successful development sessions were awarded with certificates. This memorable day ended with melodic voice of Mr Asif, Mr Moosir , Mr Waqar and Ms Tahira who entertained the audience with beautiful tunes.</p>
                <br> <br> <h3 id="rdh1">Concluding notes:</h3> 
            <p id="stdp">The overall aura of our very first CPPL – conference was considered a big success at the end, beside the entire HPS participation, the sister schools were also invited to be a part of our journey to excellence. Teachers from APWA Rana liaquat Ali Khan School and Green Shield Public School have participated in our conference.
                <br> <br>
                However the genial regrets received from HGS and Ghulaman-e-Abbas school due to their commitments at the beginning of the new academic year of their schools on the same dates. The guest speakers invited for keynote sessions were imparted their best to ensure the quality of the presentation that is equally beneficial for the participants in terms of learning new concepts and methodologies with in a great deal of time. The sessions evaluations for our in-house facilitators were also served a positive note for their efforts as few of them have came up to showcase their learning for the very first time. The platform served as a booster to their confidence in sharing their expertise with the fellow staff members.
                <br> <br>
                It was also a great honour to us to have Ms. Zehra Gheewala & Mr. Asad Ali as out -sourced facilitators for our professional development session part. The team building activity segment was the most enthralled part of all 5 days. The different mixed participations from every section at school in groups every day developed a harmony of unity, coherence and the chance of meeting the fellow colleagues of one big school generated the approach of being the part of one HPS family working together in promoting the school’s 3 in 3 vision.
                <br> <br>
                The hard work of the facilitators, who conducted the Professional Development sessions were rewarded in the form of vote of thanks by RLD team lead and the certificates of appreciation that were given to them on the same day after the team building activity at the gymnasium.
                <br> <br>
                Last but the most significant part of the all the days was to have lunch together at the end of the tiring day which was arranged by the staff for the staff. A great initiative was taken to celebrate the confirmation by the newly inducted teachers to their seniors as a token of love. The official exposure of the newly revived professional development department at HPS brought into recognition by organizing their first programme under its name, ‘Research, Learning &amp; Development HUB. The remarkable collaboration since the planning, organizing and executing the conference of the entire RLD – Team was evident throughout the conference.
                <br> <br>
                We are looking forward for the same in the days to come. We do expect the new learning and the refreshers will be transferred to the classrooms for the benefit of both the students and teachers.</p>
